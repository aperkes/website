About 2 years ago, I pitched a Computer Vision workshop for biologists as part of a fellowship. I ended up getting an NSF fellowship instead, but that workshop has been bouncing around in my head for the last couple years. Finally I decided to organize it properly, started making plans, emailing participants, organized funding, and to my surprise, it actually happened, this past weekend!

We had a great time with visiting experts Ann Kennedy, Ben Koger, Divya Murali, and lab-alum Jon Aguiñaga. I was astonished how much people (many of which had minimal coding experience) were able to get done in one day. Thanks to everyone who made this possible, including the center for population biology. Special thanks to Kate Laskowski for supporting it (via grant money from the Sloan Foundation and NIH.).

If you’re interested in network-based quantification of animal pose, I cannot recommend SLEAP enough. Check it out here:
